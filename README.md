# KCStd
- Just my implementation of the C Standard Library, this project is mainly for my learning.
## Attention
- I cannot guarantee that there will always be implementations for all architectures, my device is AARCH64.
## Build
### 1. Run buildscript
```bash
ruby build.rb --install # use -h to see all build options
```
### 2. Done
- The script will automatically figure out your architecture and build the correct files.
